# [volaland](https://github.com/volaland/volaland)

[volaland](https://github.com/volaland/volaland) is a Scala library for working with [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) using geo spatial time series blockchain with proof of time&location consensus protocol. 

It consists of the following modules:

* `gtb-dataset` for the spatial time series blockchain `Dataset` API   
* `gtb-ml` for the Spark ML API based on `gtb-dataset`
